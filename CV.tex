\section{Work Experience}

\begin{tabular}{p{2.6cm}p{12.5cm}}
%\emph{Current} & 1\textsuperscript{st} year PhD Candidate at IMDEA Software Institute. \\
July 2019 & \textbf{Facebook} (Palo Alto, California) \\
October 2019 & \textcolor{azureblue}{\textbf{Research Intern at the Data Compression Team}} \hfill Manager: \emph{Yann Collet}. \\
& During this internship, I analyzed the strengths of grammar-based compression and its applicability within the next generation of data compressors.
In order to perform this analysis, I built a prototype of a grammar-based compressor in C.

September 2016 & \textbf{IMDEA Software Institute} (Madrid, Spain) \\
Current & \textcolor{azureblue}{\textbf{PhD Student}}\hfill Manager: \emph{Pierre Ganty}\\

& My PhD is focused on Applications of Language Theory.
Some of the most relevant projects I have worked on as part of my PhD are:\\
[3pt]
& \textcolor{battleshipgrey}{\textbf{Searching on Compressed Text}} \\
[2pt]
& We studied the problem of searching with regular expressions on compressed text without decompression. We devised a simple technique that speeds up the search by using the information about repetitions on the text highlighted by the compressor.
We implemented a tool,\emph{zearch}, for counting the number of lines matching the expression which outperforms the state of the art.
The results were published at the \emph{Data Compression Conference}. \\
[3pt]
& \textcolor{battleshipgrey}{\textbf{Automata Minimization}} \\
[2pt]
& We defined a framework of automata constructions based on equivalences over words that unifies the different existing techniques for automata minimization.
The most relevant aspect of this work is that our framework offers a new explanation for the Brzozowski's algorithm, which was previously considered as orthogonal to the rest of algorithms.
This work was published at the \emph{Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science} conference

\begin{tabular}{p{2.6cm}p{12.5cm}}
September 2015 & \textbf{IMDEA Software Institute} (Madrid, Spain) \\
May 2016 & \textcolor{azureblue}{\textbf{Part-time Intern}} \hfill Manager: \emph{Pierre Ganty} \\
& During this internship, we studied whether different idioms, common among network protocols, could be validated by using parser generators for context-free languages.
We implemented a modular, robust, and efficient input validator for HTTP relying on context-free grammars and regular expressions.
We published the obtained results at the ATVA conference. 
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{2.6cm}p{12.5cm}}
June 2015 & \textbf{Max Planck Institute for Software Systems} (Kaiserslautern, Germany) \\
September 2015 & \textcolor{azureblue}{\textbf{Intern}} \hfill Manager: \emph{Rupak Majumdar} \\
& We used the \href{https://www.ros.org/}{Robot Operative System} to simulate a robot which was controlled by a combination of voice commands and hand gestures (captured with a \href{https://www.leapmotion.com/}{Leap Motion} device).
I designed and implemented a system to handle the given commands and execute them according to their priorities.

June 2014 & \textbf{IMDEA Software Institute} (Madrid, Spain) \\
May 2015 & \textcolor{azureblue}{\textbf{Intern}} \hfill Manager: \emph{Pierre Ganty}\\
& The goal of this project was to update the tool \href{https://github.com/pierreganty/mist/wiki}{mist}, a safety checker for Petri Nets and extensions implemented by my supervisor Pierre Ganty.
In particular, I implemented new python scripts to better test and benchmark the tool and I also used the JavaScript library D3 to improve the presentation of the results.
